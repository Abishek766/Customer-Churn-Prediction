# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts customer churn based on behavior and service usage data using various machine learning models.

## 📌 Overview
Customer churn refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn helps companies retain customers and improve their services.

This project uses the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset and implements a complete machine learning pipeline.
